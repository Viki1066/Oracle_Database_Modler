HealthOne Medical Database

Project Scenario:

You are a small database consulting company specializing in developing databases for
the medical industry. You have just been awarded the contract to develop a data
model for a database application system for a mid-size health insurance company to
keep track of health claims including patient information, provider(doctor)
information, information about patient visits to their doctor as well as prescription
drugs prescribed to patients.
Information such as patient name, address, phone, email etc. are needed as well as
who each patient’s primary care doctor is, their insurance ID number and insurance
company name. We also want information on each doctor such as their specialty and
what hospitals they are affiliated with as well as their phone, address etc. Regarding
the hospitals themselves we will need to know where they are located and how to
contact them.
The prescriptions given to each patient by a health-care provider also need to be
tracked in this particular database at this time to determine claim eligibility including
some basic information on the drug being prescribed to make sure there are no
conflicts with a patient’s other prescriptions. We need to know each drug’s name,
purpose/use and possible side effects.
Eventually, the database will be used to track trends and for some extrapolative
modeling based on the accumulated data. The database will be accessible in English
only right now, although plans include making it available in multiple languages
eventually
